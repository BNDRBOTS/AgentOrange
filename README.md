# AgentOrange
AgentOrange™ is the "Audit > Magic" automation engine. It prioritizes safety using a strict Security Kernel and Transactional VFS. Features include atomic writes, automatic rollbacks, and a hardened sandbox that blocks access to secrets like .env and .git. If it's not logged, it didn't happen.
